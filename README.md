# Graph Builder UI

A ReactFlow-based dashboard for visualizing and managing cloud infrastructure services as an interactive node graph. Built with React, TypeScript, ReactFlow, TanStack Query, and Zustand.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Graph Canvas** — drag, zoom, pan, and connect service nodes using ReactFlow
- **App Switching** — select between multiple applications, each with its own service graph
- **Node Inspector Panel** — click any node to view and edit its details in a side panel
- **Status Pills** — visual indicators for `Healthy`, `Degraded`, and `Down` service states
- **Synced Slider + Input** — CPU limit control with a range slider and numeric input kept in sync
- **Tabbed Inspector** — `Config` and `Runtime` tabs per node, with a live CPU usage bar chart
- **Mock API Layer** — simulated network latency and loading/error states via TanStack Query
- **Responsive Layout** — right panel collapses into a mobile slide-over drawer on small screens
- **Delete Nodes** — remove a selected node via the `Delete`/`Backspace` key or a button
- **Fit View** — manually re-center the graph, or have it auto-fit on window resize

## 🧠 Key Decisions

- **Mock API via `setTimeout`, not MSW** — the task allowed either approach; `setTimeout`-wrapped promises were chosen for simplicity since no real network interception was required for this scope.
- **Nodes and edges live fully in Zustand, not local ReactFlow state** — `Canvas` and `RightPanel` are sibling components with no direct parent-child relationship, so `nodes`, `edges`, `selectedAppId`, and `selectedNode` are all stored centrally in Zustand. `Canvas` writes the fetched graph into the store; `CardUi` (the inspector) reads and updates it directly via `updateNode` and `deleteNode` actions — avoiding prop drilling entirely.
- **`updateNode` and `deleteNode` as Zustand actions** — both find the target node by `id` inside the store, update or remove it immutably, and also sync `selectedNode` so the inspector panel and the canvas node never fall out of sync after an edit or deletion.
- **`queryKey: ['graph', appId]`** — including the app ID in the query key gives each app its own independent cache entry in TanStack Query, so switching back to a previously visited app renders instantly instead of refetching.
- **Custom `ServiceNode` registered via `nodeTypes`** — kept as a stable reference outside the component to avoid unnecessary remounts on every render, which otherwise caused click handlers to misfire.
- **CPU bar chart built with plain CSS, no chart library** — a set of `div` elements with randomized, capped heights was sufficient to visually represent load without adding a charting dependency.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- The mock API has a randomized failure chance to simulate error states — refreshing may occasionally show an error card by design.
- Node positions and edits are held in client-side state only; nothing persists after a page refresh.
- The bar chart in the Runtime tab uses randomized values scaled by CPU percentage rather than real historical metrics.
- Only one custom node type (`ServiceNode`) is implemented; all services share the same visual template.
- Mobile drawer behavior is functional but canvas resizing on viewport changes may require clicking "Fit" rather than adjusting fully automatically in all cases.
